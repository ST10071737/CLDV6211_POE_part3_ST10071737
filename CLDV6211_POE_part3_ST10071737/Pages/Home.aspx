                <h3>Streamlined Management</h3>
                <p>We are in the process of transitioning from a paper-based system to a comprehensive management system. This will enable us to efficiently manage drivers, rentals, returns, and late fees, improving our overall operations and ensuring a seamless experience for everyone involved.</p>

                <h3>Mobile-Friendly Access</h3>
                <p>Our system will be accessible from both desktop computers and mobile phones. Inspectors, who collect vehicles at pick-up points, will use mobile devices to log returns, ensuring real-time updates and minimizing paperwork.</p>

                <h3>Future Expansion</h3>
                <p>While we initially require functionalities related to Driver, Inspector, Vehicle, Rental, and Return management, we have plans to expand the system's capabilities in the future. Our aim is to continuously improve our services and provide additional features that benefit both drivers and passengers.</p>
